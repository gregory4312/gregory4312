# Hey, I'm Greg ðŸ‘‹

I build tools that make learning more engaging, mostly by bridging the gap between Minecraft: Education Edition and modern web development. I love creating things that solve real problems for educators and developers.

## What I'm Working On

My main focus is on the **Minecraft Education Ecosystem**â€”a collection of tools designed to streamline content creation and management:

### Core Minecraft Tools

*   **[Minecraft String Formatter](https://github.com/gregory4312/Minecraft-String-Formatter)** - A straightforward web tool that takes the headache out of formatting JSON UI binding strings for Minecraft. (Currently unavailable)
*   **[NPC Dialogue Designer](https://github.com/gregory4312/NPC-Dialogue-Designer)** - Create and manage branching dialogue trees for in-game NPCs with a visual editor. (Currently unavailable)
*   **[Minecraft Bedrock Dialogue Hover Text](https://github.com/gregory4312/Minecraft-Bedrock-Dialogue-Hover-Text)** - A VS Code extension I built to save time while coding. It shows dialogue keys directly in your JSON files. *(1 star)*
*   **[FlashCards Designer for Minecraft Edu](https://github.com/gregory4312/FlashCards-Designer-for-Minecraft-Edu)** - Lets educators quickly build interactive flashcards with custom game mechanics.
*   **[Minecraft Education Websocket](https://github.com/gregory4312/Minecraft-Education-Websocket)** - A local portal for managing the game experience, powered by Go and real-time websocket connections.
*   **[Portable Tutorial Addon](https://github.com/gregory4312/Portable-Tutorial-Addon)** - A reusable tutorial system for Minecraft Bedrock and Education Edition.

### Web & Automation Tools

*   **[Cover Letter Generator](https://github.com/gregory4312/Cover-Letter-Generator)** - A small app that uses AI to help draft personalized cover letters.
*   **[PPTX File Translator](https://github.com/gregory4312/pptx-file-Translator)** - Translates PowerPoint files into multiple languages through a simple web interface.

## Tech I Use

**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Go  
**Platforms & Tools:** Node.js, VS Code Extension API, WebSockets, HTML/CSS, Git  
**Domains:** Minecraft Bedrock/Education Edition, AI Integration, Educational Technology

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm actively maintaining and improving my existing Minecraft tools, exploring new ways to integrate AI for content generation, and always on the lookout for the next productivity hurdle to solve.
